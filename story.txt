Once upon a time, there was a kingdom of frogs. The kingdom is known for a amazing magic that modern people have forgotten for a long time, the magic of time. One frog in the city knows the most powerful tell, a tell that takes time away from living creatures and move those seconds to another. People visit the amazing city to help other people in need, sometimes they donate time to those old people with wisdom, sometimes they put time on people about to pass away.
	Unfortunately, what people don't know before they visit is that they can't control whether time is taken or given when they enter the kingdom. Therefore going to this kingdom of frogs is a dangerous game as life is given and taken without a second thought. Old people can head there with the attempt for their life to be restored just to have it taken from their fingertips, while others are gifted years onto the ends of theirs. But people love the mystery and that is why they continue to go and face the odds.
Fear-mongering by hostile foreign governments cause the kingdom to lose everything, from tourism to trade. Now, inevitable colllapse awaits.
